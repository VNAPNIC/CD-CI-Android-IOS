In this example, the pipeline includes four stages: build, test, and deploy. 

The `before_script` section installs the necessary dependencies for both Android and iOS development. 

The `build_android` and `test_android` stages run the gradlew commands to build and test the Android application, and the `build_ios` and `test_ios` stages run the `xcodebuild` commands to build and test the iOS application. 

The `deploy_ios` stage uses the fastlane tool to deploy the iOS application to Testflight, and the `deploy_android` stage uses the `./gradlew firebase_deploy` command to deploy the Android application to Firebase.

Push your code to the GitLab repository and trigger the pipeline. 

The pipeline will run automatically on each push to the repository, and the results will be available in the GitLab UI.

This is just one example of how to set up a GitLab CI/CD pipeline to build, test, and deploy an Android and iOS application using Docker and Firebase/Testflight. 

The exact steps and configurations may vary depending on your specific requirements and the tools and technologies you use. 

However, the goal is to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying your applications, so that you can ensure the quality and reliability of your code with each change.
